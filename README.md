# overview
AquaRush is an endless runner game based on subway surfer, but the twist is its set in the ocean with boats with the player controlling a boat speeding through objects and collecting coins. The goal as most endless runners is to reach the farthest distance possible while collecting coins and avoiding all the hazards of the sea.

# known issues-Bugs
- Occasional coin spawns slightly offset from lanes.  
- Boat selection menu UI needs polishing on different resolutions.

# future plans
For this project id like to push it out to itch.io and make an actual game of it. Id also like to push out versions for phone as well. Game wise id like to push for a complete shop system for the player to buy boats, collectables, and or powerups to use, I think this would be a good addition adding some flexiablity for the player in the game and visual appeal to the game. Id like to generally push for better graphics in the future i believe this would up the want to play the game in the players eyes.
